#  Labwork 2: Cryptographic Weaknesses in Database Authentication

##  Objectives

1. Identify and exploit cryptographic weaknesses in database authentication and password storage.
2. Perform offline hash cracking after discovering password hashes in a vulnerable database.
3. Investigate real-world cryptographic failures and propose secure solutions.
4. Document findings clearly in GitHub (Markdown) and present a short demo/debrief.


## 🛠️ Setup Used
- Kali Linux
- Metasploitable 2

##  Task Breakdown

### 1. Service Enumeration

In this task, we're trying to Identify the database service and try connecting to it. By using this command 

```sh
nmap -sV <192.168.163.139>
```
